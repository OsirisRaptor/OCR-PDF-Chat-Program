1. Dependencies:
   - Python's built-in libraries: os, sys
   - External libraries: PyPDF2 (for pdf reading), sympy (for equation parsing), nltk (for context analysis), flask (for app interface)

2. Exported Variables:
   - `pdf_file`: The PDF file to be read.
   - `equation`: The equation extracted from the PDF.
   - `paper_context`: The context of the paper extracted from the PDF.
   - `equation_explanation`: The explanation of how the equation works.
   - `context_relation`: The relation of the equation to the rest of the paper.

3. Data Schemas:
   - `Equation`: A schema to represent the equation, its explanation, and its relation to the paper context.

4. Function Names:
   - `read_pdf`: Function to read the PDF file.
   - `parse_equation`: Function to parse the equation from the PDF.
   - `explain_equation`: Function to explain how the equation works.
   - `analyze_context`: Function to analyze the context of the paper.
   - `relate_equation`: Function to relate the equation to the rest of the paper.
   - `run_app`: Function to run the app interface.

5. Message Names:
   - `equation_found`: Message when an equation is found in the PDF.
   - `equation_explained`: Message when the equation is explained.
   - `context_analyzed`: Message when the paper context is analyzed.
   - `relation_found`: Message when the relation of the equation to the paper is found.

6. Test Function Names:
   - `test_read_pdf`: Test function for `read_pdf`.
   - `test_parse_equation`: Test function for `parse_equation`.
   - `test_explain_equation`: Test function for `explain_equation`.
   - `test_analyze_context`: Test function for `analyze_context`.
   - `test_relate_equation`: Test function for `relate_equation`.
   - `test_run_app`: Test function for `run_app`.
